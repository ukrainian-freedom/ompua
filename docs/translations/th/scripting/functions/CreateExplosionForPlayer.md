## คำอธิบาย

Creates an explosion that is only visible to a single player. This can be used to isolate explosions from other players or to make them only appear in specific virtual worlds.

This function always returns 1, even if the function failed to excute (player doesn't exist, invalid radius, or invalid explosion type).

## ตัวอย่าง

```c
if (strcmp(cmdtext, "/burnme", true) == 0)
{
    new Float:POS[3];
    GetPlayerPos(playerid, POS[0], POS[1], POS[2]);
    CreateExplosionForPlayer(playerid, POS[0], POS[1], POS[2], 1, 10.0);
    return 1;
}
```

:::tip

There is a limit as to how many explosions can be seen at once by a player. This is roughly 10.
