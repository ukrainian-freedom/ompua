The integer value of the specified player variable. It will still return 0 if the variable is not set, or the player does not exist.

## ตัวอย่าง

```c
public OnPlayerDisconnect(playerid,reason)
{
    printf("money: %d", GetPVarInt(playerid, "money")); // get the saved value ('money')
    // will print 'money: amount'
    return 1;
}
```

## บันทึก

:::tip

Variables aren't reset until after OnPlayerDisconnect is called, so the values are still accessible in OnPlayerDisconnect.
