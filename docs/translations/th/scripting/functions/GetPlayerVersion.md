## บันทึก

:::tip

A client's version can be up to 24 characters long, otherwise the connection will be rejected due to "Invalid client connection". However, normal players can only join with a version length between 5 (0.3.7) and 9 (0.3.DL-R1) characters.

:::

:::warning

The string the version gets stored in will be empty if playerid is an NPC.
