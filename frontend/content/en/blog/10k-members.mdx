Hey everyone!

We reached an amazing milestone recently: we officially hit 10,000 USERS in our Discord! ðŸ¥³ðŸ”ŸðŸ¥³

We thought we would take this opportunity to give a small update as we know it's been a while and everyone is wondering what's going on!

As all of the dev team has full-time jobs and other commitments, we have all really been messed around with the COVID situation. That means that we have not had much time to dedicate to open.mp for a while now. 

But things have picked up again recently, we are still alive, the project is truly moving along faster than ever, and we have made more progress in the last few weeks than we have in a long time! 

We are so proud of the work going into this, and of the amazing refined team we have. 

We will give more detailed info in the coming months, but we just wanted to make sure everyone knows we have not abandoned open.mp, the passion is still there, and we are doing the best we can. So please stick with us as we will have some news and some screenshots and videos very soon!

In the meantime, come hang out with us on Discord! Thank you to all 10,000+ of you ðŸ¥°
